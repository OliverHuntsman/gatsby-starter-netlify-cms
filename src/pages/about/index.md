### Makeup that enhances your natural beauty without masking it
Makeup should enhance everything you have, it should be feel like you, look incredbile, here at Gemma Sutton 

### About me xx
I'm the typical creative, mind everywhere at once always looking for new inspiration

I live and work with my partner Olly and we have to little ones together - Spencer & CoCo

### I wouldn't be abe to do anything without the amazing team I have around me xx

In 2013 I started working with Fran, an absolutely wonderful soul and super organised xx Fran is my Creative Director and makes sure everything happens

I wouldn't be able to make the big day so special without my absolutely amazing Pro Team, one of the best htings about running a small business is choosing to work with people you love

Michelle is one of the closest Pro Team members I have

### Pro Team - who makes the cut
I'm quite choosy - or so I'm told, when a friend asked Miss Rose Gold what it is like working with Gemma - great, so long as you're getting it right! 

I set incredbily high standards for myself and my Pro Team is an extension of me and those standards xx

### Working responsbly
Where possbile I activly encourage the use of cruelty free products
The cosmetics industry as a whole has a lot of work to do in terms of a cruelty free commitment

In December of 2019 I ran a campaign and circulated 4,000 stickers to fellow makeup artists to cover up their products 

Some of the best products out there are yet to make the cruelty free commitment 

### Giving back

I donate 1% of my profits to good causes, this year I've donated to

* action aid for women 
* [OFI - Orangutan Foundation International](https://orangutan.org/our-projects/forest-stewardship/purchase-and-protection/) who purchase rainforests to protect Orangutans natural habits
